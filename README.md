# Covid Cases Density

### 1 - Scope
The purpose of this project is to implement a sorting algorithm with Priority Queues so that it can be used to find the cities with the highest density of covid
cases.

### 2 - Application *Covid_k*
The application will read the daily covid cases report from  a text file. Then, it will ask the user for the parameter k that represents the number of the cities that user want to print. Lastly, the application will print the top k cities with higher cases numbers per 50,000 citizens. The application implemented with custom Priority Queue.

### 3 - Application *DynamicCovid_k_withPQ*
Same as the previous application with only difference that in the Priority Queue retain only the k cities with higher cases numbers per 50,000 citizens every time the application reads a new single line from the text file. This means that we do not keep data in the Priority Queue that we do not need.

### 4 - Application *Dynamic_Median*
In this application we read an input file again in the same format, and we are interested in answering questions like: â€œHow much
high cases density a city needs to have to be in the top 50% of cities we are looking at? " (to enter a yellow zone e.g.). This means that we calculate the median from the covid case densities we have.
